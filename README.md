I learned how to center a div

```css
body{
    min-height: 100vh;
    display: flex;
    align-items: center;
    
}

.container{
    max-width: 360px;
    margin: 0 auto;

}
```

### Continued development

want to make QR code work, Make it responsive, and may make it a part of website page


### Useful resources

- [Center a div](https://www.joshwcomeau.com/css/center-a-div/) - This is an amazing article which helped me finally understand centering methods. I'd recommend it to anyone still learning this concept.
